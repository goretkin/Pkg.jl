# **5.** Creating Packages

A package is a project with a `name`, `uuid` and `version` entry in the `Project.toml` file `src/PackageName.jl` file that defines the module `PackageName`.
This file is executed when the package is loaded.

### Generating files for a package

To generate files for a new package, use `pkg> generate`.

```
(v1.0) pkg> generate HelloWorld
```

This creates a new project `HelloWorld` with the following files (visualized with the external [`tree` command](https://linux.die.net/man/1/tree)):

```jl
shell> cd HelloWorld

shell> tree .
.
├── Project.toml
└── src
    └── HelloWorld.jl

1 directory, 2 files
```

The `Project.toml` file contains the name of the package, its unique UUID, its version, the author and eventual dependencies:

```toml
name = "HelloWorld"
uuid = "b4cd1eb8-1e24-11e8-3319-93036a3eb9f3"
version = "0.1.0"
author = ["Some One <someone@email.com>"]

[deps]
```

The content of `src/HelloWorld.jl` is:

```jl
module HelloWorld

greet() = print("Hello World!")

end # module
```

We can now activate the project and load the package:

```jl
pkg> activate .

julia> import HelloWorld

julia> HelloWorld.greet()
Hello World!
```

### Adding dependencies to the project

Let’s say we want to use the standard library package `Random` and the registered package `JSON` in our project.
We simply `add` these packages (note how the prompt now shows the name of the newly generated project,
since we are inside the `HelloWorld` project directory):

```
(HelloWorld) pkg> add Random JSON
 Resolving package versions...
  Updating "~/Documents/HelloWorld/Project.toml"
 [682c06a0] + JSON v0.17.1
 [9a3f8284] + Random
  Updating "~/Documents/HelloWorld/Manifest.toml"
 [34da2185] + Compat v0.57.0
 [682c06a0] + JSON v0.17.1
 [4d1e1d77] + Nullables v0.0.4
 ...
```

Both `Random` and `JSON` got added to the project’s `Project.toml` file, and the resulting dependencies got added to the `Manifest.toml` file.
The resolver has installed each package with the highest possible version, while still respecting the compatibility that each package enforce on its dependencies.

We can now use both `Random` and `JSON` in our project. Changing `src/HelloWorld.jl` to

```
module HelloWorld

import Random
import JSON

greet() = print("Hello World!")
greet_alien() = print("Hello ", Random.randstring(8))

end # module
```

and reloading the package, the new `greet_alien` function that uses `Random` can be used:

```
julia> HelloWorld.greet_alien()
Hello aT157rHV
```

### Adding a build step to the package.

The build step is executed the first time a package is installed or when explicitly invoked with `build`.
A package is built by executing the file `deps/build.jl`.

```
shell> cat deps/build.log
I am being built...

(HelloWorld) pkg> build
  Building HelloWorld → `deps/build.log`
 Resolving package versions...

shell> cat deps/build.log
I am being built...
```

If the build step fails, the output of the build step is printed to the console

```
shell> cat deps/build.jl
error("Ooops")

(HelloWorld) pkg> build
  Building HelloWorld → `deps/build.log`
 Resolving package versions...
┌ Error: Error building `HelloWorld`:
│ ERROR: LoadError: Ooops
│ Stacktrace:

│ in expression starting at /Users/kristoffer/.julia/dev/Pkg/HelloWorld/deps/build.jl:1
└ @ Pkg.Operations Operations.jl:938
```

### Adding tests to the package

When a package is tested the file `test/runtests.jl` is executed.

```
shell> cat test/runtests.jl
println("Testing...")
(HelloWorld) pkg> test
   Testing HelloWorld
 Resolving package versions...
Testing...
   Testing HelloWorld tests passed
```

#### Test-specific dependencies

Sometimes one might want to use some packages only at testing time but not
enforce a dependency on them when the package is used. This is possible by
adding dependencies to `[extras]` and a `test` target in `[targets]` to the Project file.
Here we add the `Test` standard library as a test-only dependency by adding the
following to the Project file:

```
[extras]
Test = "8dfed614-e22c-5e08-85e1-65c5234f0b40"

[targets]
test = ["Test"]
```

We can now use `Test` in the test script and we can see that it gets installed on testing:

```
shell> cat test/runtests.jl
using Test
@test 1 == 1

(HelloWorld) pkg> test
   Testing HelloWorld

```
